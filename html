        <p>Red Eared Sliders originated around the Mississippi River and the southeastern United States of America.</p>
        <p>Some Red Eared Sliders will live as long as 30 years, and can grow to nearly 9 inches long.</p>
        <p>As these turtles cannot self regulate their body temperature, they are reliant on exterior heating sources.</p>
